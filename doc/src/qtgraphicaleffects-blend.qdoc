/*!
    \qmlproperty bool QtGraphicalEffects1::Blend::cached

    This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to improve the rendering performance.

    Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in the cache must be updated.
    Memory consumption is increased, because an extra buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

    It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect properties are animated.

    By default, the property is set to false.
