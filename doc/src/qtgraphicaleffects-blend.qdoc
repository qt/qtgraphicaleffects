/*!
    \qmlproperty variant Blend::source

    This property defines the source item that is going to be the base when \l foregroundSource is blended over it.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty variant Blend::foregroundSource

    This property defines the item that is going to be blended over the \l source.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string Blend::mode

    This property defines the mode which is used when foregroundSource is blended over source. Values are
    case insensitive.

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Blend::cached

    This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to improve the rendering performance.

    Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in the cache must be updated.
    Memory consumption is increased, because an extra buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

    It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect properties are animated.

    By default, the property is set to false.
