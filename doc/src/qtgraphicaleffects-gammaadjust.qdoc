    \brief Alters the luminance of the source item.

    GammaAdjust is applied to each pixel according to the curve which is
    pre-defined as a power-law expression, where the property gamma is used as the
    reciprocal scaling exponent. Refer to the property documentation of \l{GammaAdjust::gamma}{gamma}
    for more details.

/*!
    \qmlproperty variant QtGraphicalEffects1::GammaAdjust::source

    This property defines the source item for which the luminance is going to be
    adjusted.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real QtGraphicalEffects1::GammaAdjust::gamma

    This property defines the change factor for how the luminance of each pixel
    is altered according to the equation:

    \code luminance = pow(original_luminance, 1.0 / gamma); // The luminance is assumed to be between 0.0 and 1.0 \endcode

    Setting the gamma values under 1.0 makes the image darker, the values
    above 1.0 lighten it.

    The value ranges from 0.0 (darkest) to inf (lightest). By default, the property
    is set to \c 1.0 (no change).

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool QtGraphicalEffects1::GammaAdjust::cached

    This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
    improve the rendering performance.

    Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in the
    cache must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an extra
    buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

    It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
    properties are animated.

    By default, the property is set to \c false.
