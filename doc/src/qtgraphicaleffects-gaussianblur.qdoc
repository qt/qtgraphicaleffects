    \qmlclass GaussianBlur
    \inqmlmodule QtGraphicalEffects
    \brief Applies a higher quality blur effect.

    GaussianBlur effect softens the image by blurring it with an algorithm that
    uses the Gaussian function to calculate the effect. The effect produces
    higher quality than \l FastBlur, but is slower to render.

/*!
    \qmlproperty variant QtGraphicalEffects::GaussianBlur::source

    This property defines the source item that is going to be blurred.

*/
/*!
    \qmlproperty real QtGraphicalEffects::GaussianBlur::radius

    This property defines the distance of the neighboring pixels which affect
    the blurring of an individual pixel. A larger radius increases the blur
    effect.

    Depending on the radius value, value of the \l samples should be set to
    sufficiently large to ensure the visual quality.

    The value ranges from 0.0 (no blur) to inf. By default, the property is set to
    \c 0.0 (no blur).

/*!
    \qmlproperty int QtGraphicalEffects::GaussianBlur::samples

    This property defines how many samples are taken per pixel when blur
    calculation is done. Larger value produces better quality, but is slower
    to render.

    Ideally, this value should be twice as large as the highest required radius
    value, for example, if the radius is animated between 0.0 and 4.0, samples
    should be set to 8.

    The value ranges from 0 to 32. By default, the property is set to \c 0.

    This property is not intended to be animated. Changing this property may
    cause the underlying OpenGL shaders to be recompiled.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real QtGraphicalEffects::GaussianBlur::deviation

    This property is a parameter to the gaussian function that is used when
    calculating neighboring pixel weights for the blurring. A larger deviation
    causes image to appear more blurry, but it also reduces the quality of the
    blur. A very large deviation value causes the effect to look a bit similar
    to what, for exmple, a box blur algorithm produces. A too small deviation
    values makes the effect insignificant for the pixels near the radius.

    \inlineimage GaussianBlur_deviation_graph.png
    \caption The image above shows the Gaussian function with two different
    deviation values, yellow (1) and cyan (2.7). The y-axis shows the weights,
    the x-axis shows the pixel distance.

    The value ranges from 0.0 (no deviation) to inf (maximum deviation). By
    default, devaition is binded to radius. When radius increases, deviation is
    automatically increased linearly. With the radius value of 8, the deviation
    default value becomes approximately 2.7034. This value produces a compromise
    between the blur quality and overall blurriness.

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool QtGraphicalEffects::GaussianBlur::transparentBorder

    This property defines the blur behavior near the edges of the item, where
    the pixel blurring is affected by the pixels outside the source edges.

    If the property is set to \c true, the pixels outside the source are
    interpreted to be transparent, which is similar to OpenGL clamp-to-border
    extension. The blur is expanded slightly outside the effect item area.

    If the property is set to \c false, the pixels outside the source are 
    interpreted to contain the same color as the pixels at the edge of the item, 
    which is similar to OpenGL clamp-to-edge behavior. The blur does not expand 
    outside the effect item area.

    By default, the property is set to \c false.

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool QtGraphicalEffects::GaussianBlur::cached

    This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
    improve the rendering performance.
    Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in the cache
    must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an extra buffer of
    memory is required for storing the effect output.

    It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
    properties are animated.

    By default, the property is set to \c false.
