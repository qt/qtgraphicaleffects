    \qmlclass ZoomBlur
    \inqmlmodule QtGraphicalEffects
    \brief Applies directional blur effect towards source items center point.

    Effect creates perceived impression that the source item appears to be
    moving towards the center point in Z-direction or that the camera appears
    to be zooming rapidly. Other available motion blur effects are
    \l {QtGraphicalEffects::DirectionalBlur} {DirectionalBlur}
    and \l {QtGraphicalEffects::RadialBlur} {RadialBlur}.

/*!
    \qmlproperty variant QtGraphicalEffects::ZoomBlur::source

    This property defines the source item that is going to be blurred.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real QtGraphicalEffects::ZoomBlur::length

    This property defines the maximum perceived amount of movement for each
    pixel. The amount is smaller near the center and reaches the specified
    value at the edges.

    The quality of the blur depends on \l samples property. If length value is
    large, more samples are needed to keep the visual quality at high level.

    The value ranges from 0.0 to inf.
    By default the property is set to \c 0.0 (no blur).

/*!
    \qmlproperty real QtGraphicalEffects::ZoomBlur::samples

    This property defines how many samples are taken per pixel when blur
    calculation is done. Larger value produces better quality, but is slower
    to render.

    This property is not intended to be animated. Changing this property may
    cause the underlying OpenGL shaders to be recompiled.

    Allowed values are between 0 and inf (practical maximum depends on GPU).
    By default the property is set to \c 0 (no samples).

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real QtGraphicalEffects::ZoomBlur::horizontalOffset
    \qmlproperty real QtGraphicalEffects::ZoomBlur::verticalOffset

    These properties define an offset in pixels for the blur direction center
    point.

    The values range from -inf to inf. By default these properties are set
    to \c 0.

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool QtGraphicalEffects::ZoomBlur::transparentBorder

    This property defines the blur behavior near the edges of the item, where
    the pixel blurring is affected by the pixels outside the source edges.

    If the property is set to \c true, the pixels outside the source are
    interpreted to be transparent, which is similar to OpenGL clamp-to-border
    extension. The blur is expanded slightly outside the effect item area.

    If the property is set to \c false, the pixels outside the source are 
    interpreted to contain the same color as the pixels at the edge of the item, 
    which is similar to OpenGL clamp-to-edge behavior. The blur does not expand 
    outside the effect item area.

    By default, the property is set to \c false.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool QtGraphicalEffects::ZoomBlur::cached

    This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
    improve the rendering performance.

    Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in the
    cache must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an extra
    buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

    It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
    properties are animated.

    By default, the property is set to \c false.
