    \inherits QtQuick2::Item
    \brief Alters the colors of the source item by applying an overlay color.

    The effect is similar to what happens when a colorized glass is put on top
    of a grayscale image. The color for the overlay is given in the RGBA format.

    \table
    \header
        \li Source
        \li Effect applied
    \row
        \li \image Original_butterfly.png
        \li \image ColorOverlay_butterfly.png
    \endtable

    \section1 Example

    The following example shows how to apply the effect.

/*!
    \qmlproperty variant ColorOverlay::source

    This property defines the source item that provides the source pixels for
    the effect.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty color ColorOverlay::color

    This property defines the RGBA color value which is used to colorize the source.

    By default, the property is set to \c "transparent".

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Colorize::cached

    This property allows the effect output pixels to be cached in order to
    improve the rendering performance.

    Every time the source or effect properties are changed, the pixels in the
    cache must be updated. Memory consumption is increased, because an extra
    buffer of memory is required for storing the effect output.

    It is recommended to disable the cache when the source or the effect
    properties are animated.

    By default, the property is set to \c false.
